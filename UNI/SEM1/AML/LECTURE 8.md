>[!danger] TO DO!!!!
• What is an RNN?
• For what kind of data do we use RNN?
• What is the difference between an RNN and a FNN?
• What is unfolding? How is it used?
• Are there different types of RNN concerning input and output?
• What is the difference between a Jordan and an Elman RNN?
• How many parameters does a vanilla Elman RNN have?
• What is the relation between RNN and dynamical systems?
• How do eigenvalues of a certain weight matrix and stability relate to each other?
• What is backpropagation through time? How does it work?
• How does the update of the weights and biases look like?
• In which order can these updates be computed?
• How would you implement RNN?
# Alles
## MOTIVATION
- To basically counter an continous stream of data, when we dont have a fixed number of data.
- Basically time based finite data.
## CELLS and LAYERS
