- Ther are two extreme cases
	- {phi, and omega}  : this is just a trivial case of sigma fields.
	- P(omega) : which is just the power set of all the subset of omega.
# 1.1.3 Measure and measure space
![[Pasted image 20250407153901.png]]
- pt 1 : mesaure of an empty set is zero 
- pt 2 : is sigma additivity. if two subsets are pairwise disjoint.
> with these simple axioms we can introduce many other ones.

- Dirac measure give only two values : 
	- 1 if the x belong to the set
	- 0 otherwise.

### 1.1.5 Prob space and Prob measure.

>example : ({first set of 1st 6 integers}, {powerset of all the intergers}, probability)

- same as 1st six numbers which can appear as a power set linearly combined Dirac function. Hence a fair roll of die.
# 1.1.7

- just take a number since it is not a sigma field, so you add more and more terms to it.
>[!imp] 
> That sigma(A) is indeed a sigma-field will be shows in the excercie.

# 1.1.9 Borel Sigma-field (Go to measure)
![[Pasted image 20250407160909.png]]
> - (aii, bi] : these are just rectangles. ai, bi must belong to R and ai<= bi
> - generated by open set of R.
> - it measures topology and measure theory. topoloy defines continuous function. 

### Theorem 1.1.11 
![[Pasted image 20250407161443.png]]
- what we expect the area of rectangle , cube : volume.
- if you shift around the the subsets you measure does not change.

#### How to make prob measure out of this.
- after applying rotation and translation does not change.
### Example
![[Pasted image 20250407162227.png]]
- we have restricted to set W. then we normalize by dividing lambda(W). we get probability measure.
