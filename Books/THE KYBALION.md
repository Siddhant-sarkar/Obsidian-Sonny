## Principal of Mentalism.
- everything is mental. What your true beliefs are, what they are going to manifest.
- Mental power transcends the natural law.
>[!How to : ]
> - info = what you know + what you gain from other.
> - ** Be very selective about information that you gain or put in you brain**.
> - negative info -> forms negative block in you mind -> just does not let you manifest.
> - It is this you form unwavering faith. Through which you bring things into reality.

## Principal of Correspondence
- You outer world is the reflection of you inner world. What you don't believe that is not gonna work, its not gonna work.
- "As above so below, as so below as so above."
- **How is this related to what i want form reality.** 
	- You change yourself internally, through which you make the reality happen.
	- I have to evolve within.
	- __read psycocybernetic__.
- You will start to develop certain things, like future intutions.
>[!How to] 
> - Only support information that supports you vision and deny everything the denies you vision.
> - Observe how reality is changing around you, become more aware. Ideas will come towards you, act upon them.
> - Prying aside, the hidden information in plain eye.
> - Vision , identity , values and belief are metaphysical.

>[!imp] Its all connected.
>- We will receive ideas.
>- By lowering our vibration(increasing you Frequency)then we will get involved into those ideas, to the point that we don't even care of you own existence.
>- Like just like an artist, writer or a scientist.

- Keep you vision and ideas in mind, keep consuming information. Study yourself, make changes within.

## Principal of Vibration.
- Nothing rest, everything moves, everything vibrates.
- Your thoughts must be on what you want to achieve, when you hold you thoughts to extended period of time, you attract those things
- **Mentalism is what you want, correspondence is what you change yourself such that you tune into that vibration, vibration attracts those things for you.**
- You don't attract what you want, you attract who you are.
>[! how to ?]
> - adjust our thoughts, to what we want, and have feeling of what we want.
> - if negative, then its all going to be negative.

## Principal of Polarisation.
- Everything is dual, everything has poles, everything has its pair of opposites.
- Good and evil are the same face of two coins. Evil can be transmuted into good, by this principal.
>[! How to? ]
> - Observe what polarize you, that reveals you what you will create.
> - if something makes you angry, the you will create in the angry frequency.
> - Take the advantage of the other good pole and capitalise on that.
> - Noticing what polarizes you, and leveraging is such an underrated skill. Consiously choosing the polarities.
- NO matter how  right I am something, the truth wont be true.
- Navigating reality in flow, and snagging from good frequency to bad, because you didn't look at it in a good way.

## Principal of Rhythm.
- Like a pendulum, you can use it propel you forward and then ride it back to recovery.
- here the concept of snagging, you just don't need to stuck, let the pendulum rock.
	- How do you know what you are reacting to? Here comes the principal of correspondence.
- Six basic fears.
	- Poverty
	- Criticism
	- Ill Health
	- Loss of Love.
	- Old Age.
	- Death
		- If you don't eliminate them, they just keep you snagging and so on.

>[!To do]
> - Clean you subconsious. Most people just swing back and forth.
> - In chaos there is divine order. 
> - Use Poise and mental Firmness.

## Principal of Cause and Effect
- Every cause has its effect; Every effect has its cause; Everything happens according to law' chance is but a name for law not recognized. There are many planes of causation, but nothing escapes the law.
- Everything happens for a reason. More you are able to pinpoint what is the cause and effect.
- As you explore more, and rise above then normal plane of cause and effect, you become causers not effectors.

>[!Danger] What to do ?
> - Become the Causer not the effector.
> - Be the player not the pawns being moved.

## Principal of Gender
- Everything has masculine, feminine. No creation is ever possible without this law.
- To much masculine energy causes the growth of power to the extreme, where we lose perspective of what is most important and why we started this conquest for.
- Too much feminine leeds to being grounded such that our lives become dependent on cycles and external circumstances out of our favour.
>[!To do ] How to do ?
> - Use all the hermatic principals, which will help to keep both the energies balanced.
> - Destination[Masculine]energy, self relience, logic and intellect and Journey[Feminine] Love, patience, gentelness,  .
